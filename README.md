# discr-game-lab
Discrete game Laboratory work system

This repository contains
  - email-bot (which can take files with extension *.py from message and place them with good name in another dicrectory)
  - check-bot (which use some metaprogramming magic to run one program with different functions, which were saved by email-bot)

As for libraries I used https://github.com/ianovir/emailpy repo, but it was too hard for me to install it in right way, so I just places it here and made some improvments.

I think this code is pretty neat so please, star it.
